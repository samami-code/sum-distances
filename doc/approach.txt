To complete this exercise I will make a very basic webservice using Spring Boot. Since it's a very small project that will contain
only a couple of classes I will make the project structure as straight-forward as possible. 

For this project, the user needs to be able to input 2 values (distances) which can be summed. The user should be able to 
specify 3 additional parameters: whether the first value is in Yards or in Meters, whether the second value is in Yards or in Meters, 
and whether the result should be in Yards or in Meters.

To me, the simplest way to do this is to create a webservice that allows two Path Variables and 3 Parameters. I will choose to make 
the parameters boolean values, where true = yards, false = meters and default = meters - such that you aren't obliged to specify
the parameters.Example usages of the webservice would be:

/distance/10/5
Which should return: 10 meters + 5 meters = 15 meters

/distance/10/5?isYardsUnit1=true&isYardsUnit2=true&isYardsResult=true
Which should return: 10 yards + 5 yards = 15 yards
